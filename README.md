inf dotfiles
============

My cute little dotfiles repository. Feel free to reuse any part you like.

Usage
-----

	git clone this-repository ~/.dotfiles
	cd ~/.dotfiles
	./install

Cool features
-------------

`~/.bash\_aliases.local` is meant to be machine-specific file stored in
different branches. I use these to keep `g` -> `gedit` alias on my working
laptop for instance. (despite moving back to vim)
