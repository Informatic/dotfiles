inf dotfiles
============

My cute little dotfiles repository. Feel free to reuse any part you like. For
best experience use [powerline-enabled font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/blob/develop/fontpatcher/README.rst).

Usage
-----

	git clone --recursive this-repository ~/.dotfiles
	cd ~/.dotfiles
	./install

Cool features
-------------

`~/.bash_aliases.local` is meant to be machine-specific file stored in
different branches. I use these to keep `g` -> `gedit` alias on my working
laptop for instance. (despite moving back to vim)
